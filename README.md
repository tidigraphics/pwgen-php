# pwgen-php

This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/pwgen-php, a tool to generate pronounceable, easy-to-remember, yet safe, passwords (a PHP port of GNU pwgen)

The pwgen class generates passwords which are designed to be easily memorized by humans, while being as secure as possible. Human-memorable passwords are never going to be as secure as completely random passwords. In particular, passwords generated by pwgen without the secure-option should not be used in places where the password could be attacked via a brute-force attack. On the other hand, completely randomly generated passwords have a tendency to be written down, and are subject to being compromised in that fashion.

## Usage
Generating a password is as simple as creating a new PWGen object and invoking the generate() function on it:

## Generating a Password
    <?php
        use PWGen\PasswordGenerator;
    
        $pwgen = new PasswordGenerator();
        $password = $pwgen->generate();
        echo $password;
    ?>
The output could be Theik0Sa, for example.

## Generating Lots of Passwords
If you want to generate several passwords, it's wise in terms of performance and memory consumption, to use an existing $pwgen object multiple times. Every time you invoke the generate() function, a new password is generated.

    $pwgen = new PasswordGenerator();
    for ($i=0; $i < 1000000; $i++) {
        $password = $pwgen->generate();
        echo $password;
    }
    
## Safety
This library uses the new cryptoraphically secure random number generators which are new to php7
as a fallback it uses paragonie/random_compat as a fallback
Which Random Number Generator is Used?
Debian's OpenSSL vulnerability in mind, questioning the random number generator is always a good idea.
pwgen-php uses Mersenne Twister on PHP 5.2. Mersenne Twister should not be used for cryptographic purposes, so I am working on refactoring that part. MT is part of the PHP core since PHP 4 and a portable solution.

## Why Should I Trust You / the Generated Passwords?
In fact, you should not. pwgen-php is open source. I would be happy if you took a look at the source code and report issues or improvements.

## Requirements
This library requires php 5.3 or up
